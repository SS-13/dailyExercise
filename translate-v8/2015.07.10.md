Hello, world!

Welcome to the V8 developer blog!

Historically, the V8 team has published blog posts that appeal to the wider web development audience on the Chromium blog. In order to deliver more in-depth posts especially targeted to the hardcore coder and virtual machine enthusiasts out there, we’ve spun off this V8-specific blog. Big-ticket items will continue to be posted to the Chromium blog, but we hope you’ll stay tuned here for even more posts about advanced compiler techniques, low-level performance optimizations, and all the technical bits that make V8 tick.

Happy reading!
